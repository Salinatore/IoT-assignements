# Control Unit Subsystem

This application is built to control the central part of the system.

## Quick Setup

### With uv

If you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), you can create a virtual environment using `uv venv`.

After activating it, you can run `uv sync` to install all the dependencies and then `uv run main.py` to run the project.

## Configuration

Make sure that you set the correct config in the `config.py` file.
